/**
 * Database default collation.
 *
 * All data stored in Drupal is in UTF-8. Certain databases, such as MySQL,
 * support different algorithms for comparing, indexing, and sorting characters;
 * a so called "collation". The default collation of a database normally works
 * for many use-cases, but depending on the language(s) of the stored data, it
 * may be necessary to use a different collation.
 * Important:
 * - Only set or change this value BEFORE installing Drupal, unless you know
 *   what you are doing.
 * - All database tables and columns should be in the same collation. Otherwise,
 *   string comparisons performed for table JOINs will be significantly slower.
 * - Especially when storing data in German or Russian on MySQL 5.1+, you want
 *   to use the 'utf8_unicode_ci' collation instead.
 *
 * @see http://drupal.org/node/772678
